The research on Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has experienced notable growth over the past decade, yet it still lags behind practical advancements. This study delves into the definition, evolution, and classification of RPA, along with its associated benefits and challenges. Additionally, it outlines implementation guidelines and offers a prospective outlook. Since there is an evident scarcity of comprehensive grey literature reviews in this domain, the study conducts an in-depth narrative analysis of organizational grey literature on RPA in scholarship grant and funding. This analysis encompasses organizational reports and white papers released between 2015 and 2020. The study establishes a unified definition of RPA and categorizes its diverse forms into three main types: basic automation, cognitive automation, and artificial intelligence. Moreover, it delineates the benefits of RPA across various dimensions, including monetary gains, operational simplicity, enhanced efficiency and productivity, increased flexibility and scalability, improved reliability and consistency, adherence to compliance and governance standards, elevated researcher satisfaction, heightened employee efficiency, and other long-term organizational advantages. Principal challenges associated with RPA implementation encompass awareness and perception, uncertainty regarding preparation strategies, hurdles in change management during implementation, and vendor-related challenges. The study underscores three key steps in the implementation of RPA. In summary, this research furnishes both practitioners and researchers with a comprehensive industry-oriented perspective on RPA specifically in scholarship grant and funding.
